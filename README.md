## Test Framework Cucumber BBD
- I am using Page Object Modelling to enhance test maintenance and reducing code duplication. This is one of the most famous Selenium approaches.
- I used Maven to manage and centralize my dependencies which I have pom.xml
- I use Page Object Classes to store and identify the elements that I work on
- I am using Cucumber and Gherkin language for non-technical people to understand what is going on in testing
- To interact with browsers, I am utilizing Selenium WebDriver
- I used a Cucumber Scenario outline and example feature
- In the Feature folder, I store my feature files separately, and it helps in the usability of the codes
- For assertions/verifications, to compare expected and actual results I utilize Junit assertions
- I use hook class as pre-and post-test implementations
